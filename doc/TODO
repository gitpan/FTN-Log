To do:  FTN::Log

- Add selectable log formats?

- Add To Do information, or a summary of it, as a POD section in the module?
  Could rename the BUGS section to 'BUGS AND LIMITATIONS', then add a To Do
  subsection to that. Or simply have (apparently non-standard) TODO section.

- Add functionality for multiple logging formats by using separate sub-modules
  like FTN::LOG::LogType, wherein they can use the standard Perl Log modules.

- After have updated the name of the FTN::Log project page, update the project
  link in the module to point directly to that instead of main project page.

- Clean up and reformat the Changes file.

- After the initial logging test, log several more messages then check that
  number of lines in the log matches?

- Check fields in the logged lines for correctness?
